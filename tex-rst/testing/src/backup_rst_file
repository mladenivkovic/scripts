=======================

This is some text here.

New paragraph!
Itemized list first:
\begin{itemize} 
	\item Is constant throughout a cycle;
	\item Is opposite across the equator throughout a cycle;
	\item Reverses itself from one cycle to the next.
\end{itemize}


Some more text.



In-line math: The apparent magnitude $m$ in the spectral band $x$ would be given by
math environment:
\begin{equation*}
	m_x = - 2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{F_x}{F_{x,0}}\right)
\end{equation*}
\begin{align*}
	m_x &= - 2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{F_x}{F_{x,0}}\right)
\end{align*}
\begin{equation}
	m_x = - 2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{F_x}{F_{x,0}}\right)
\end{equation}
\begin{align}
	m_x &= - 2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{F_x}{F_{x,0}}\right)
\end{align}



Trying $a$ lot of $m$ath inline $like this = \arccos(\alpha)$ and $e^{ijk} = 0$
