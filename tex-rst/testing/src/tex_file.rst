This is some text here. 


New paragraph!
Itemized list first:

 
- Is constant throughout a cycle;
- Is opposite across the equator throughout a cycle;
- Reverses itself from one cycle to the next.




Some more text.



In-line math: The apparent magnitude :math:`m` in the spectral band :math:`x` would be given by
math environment:

.. math::

	m_x = - 2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{F_x}{F_{x,0}}\right)



.. math::

	m_x &= - 2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{F_x}{F_{x,0}}\right)



.. math::

	m_x = - 2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{F_x}{F_{x,0}}\right)



.. math::

	m_x &= - 2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{F_x}{F_{x,0}}\right)





Trying :math:`a` lot of :math:`m`ath inline :math:`like this = \arccos(\alpha)` and :math:`e^{ijk} = 0`
